        Sam is a child of a failed marriage but they don't know the reason behind it. When they do ask his mom the reason for it she'll get uncomfortable 
        and said she's not comfortable with saying it unless their father. Their father has the majority of custody over Sam due to them owning an actual house and 
        his Mom feels like that it'll be better for Sam to have more space instead of being cramped in a apartment with her. Even though Sam's father has the majority of custody Sam rarely
        sees him in the house and in fact the most Sam only sees him whenever they get in trouble and get sent in the principle's office since their dad is the principle of the school. Sam
        is not alone though since he has the animals he constantly takes care of ever since he found them injured in the forest along with their best friend Tom who recently moved in into the area for his 
        parents jobs. Sam is very reckless and easily gets in trouble because of it. It even resulted in them being punished by their dad to wear the mascot suit every time there's a special event because they stole a lot of food from the cafeteria.
        Sam and Tom recently just started their second year in High School where they have Mr.Otieno as their math teacher. To Sam and Tom Mr.Otieno is the worst person to ever walk the planet since they barely do anything and he immiediately gives them
        detention. It doesn't help that Mr.Otieno gives the hardest tests and Sam finds it hard to understand it. But this second year of high school is going to be a handful than Sam orignally thought it would be. Will Sam be able to handle the things that
        happened over the year? What unexpected things will happen? Tune in to Sam's story to find out what happens to him!
