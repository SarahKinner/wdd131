			<h1>Character Storage Site Plan</h1>
			<h2>Sarah Kinner</h2>
			<h2>WDD 131.01</h2>
			<!-- In the header above, add the name or your site, your name and class number. For example if you are in section 3 you would put WDD 131.03 -->

			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>Pupose of this site is to store characters I have along with any info about them so if I forget about it I can look at it and remember what importance they have.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The audience is for my friends that are intereseted in the characters I have made and want to learn more about them. Since there's a lot of info I have on them it'll be easier for them to look through the website instead of me telling them.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I'm going to use Javascript in the website by adding a search button which will bring characters up if their name or tags are a match to what the user searched up and an organizer like alphabtecial if the user wants to look through each character in a certain way.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href=" https://coolors.co/0a6004-000000-93a8ac-b20d30"
				target="_blank"
				> https://coolors.co/0a6004-000000-93a8ac-b20d30</a
			>

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#0a6004]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[#000000]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[#93a8ac]</td>

			</table>

			<h3>Typography</h3>

Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>There's going to be an image but it depends on which character you click on. Next to the image theres going to be general info like age, likes, dislikes, and traits. Bottom theres going to be info on their story. How much I get through depends on how much time I have for the website but I'll at least do one of them here.</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>

				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here

				clear]
			</p>
